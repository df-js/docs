We know, its hard to make DiamondFire code. Lines are easier, and they are. But DiamondFire and line code never come together. Or do they?

Whats a good language to make something like this in? Python, maybe, or maybe, JavaScript. But isn't JavaScript for browsers? Wait! Node.js, perfect.

Thats what df.js is; a complete DiamondFire code compiler, from Node. We put lots of work, and the best part is that its completely open source.

Now, its not zero-dependency yet, but we are working on it. Now currently, df.js is in beta, not completely done. You might not find all the code blocks, or see some bugs.

Also, you might ask, "How does it compile to DiamondFire code?". It works by using templates, which can be placed down on the ground of your code.
